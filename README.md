### Creation of Deployment and Service Files
first we used the docker images we created before, using them as a base we created the deployment and services for all the microservices and adding the enviroment variables into the pods even if the image already had it.
### Connection Between Pods
We made sure that the Deployment and services were all in the same nameespace in order to them for being able to see between them, in addition we used the same names for the pods and how the microservices search for their dependencies.
### Local Testing
K9s was installed to do the port forwading from the pods to the host machine in order to do Testing and check the proper functioning of the application.
